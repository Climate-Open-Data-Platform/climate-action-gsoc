**These were some of the notes I was taking during the session**

- Interested in Cloud infrastructure
- Should be Open Source initiative
- Problem is cost for cloud solutions that is hard for Open Source to justify
- Need a place to bootstrap data
- Challenge to crowdsource data, hard to filter
- Need to provide a valid unit, need to provide data that make sense
- JSONLD - challenge of representing units in a proper data format
- Cheaper equipment might be good with the right model - sensors are costly
- Scalability and backend is main pain point - Need to adjust data for visualization
- If you publish data in public, people will follow
- Emission reports are inaccurate, serious thing, data needs to be more precise and validated
- Weather patterns change - Serious results in for instance, India
- Platform for data - licensing made correctly - data validated to be correct, open and             available
- Suggestion: Country to Country defines policies
- IPFS: Sharing data you have left to spare - Scales if performance is not in the picture
- Opinion: Aggregation -> Representing data right way is the bottleneck, adjust metrics to          scenarios
- Suggestion: Extractors that are configurable to an appropriate structure might be a way to go, don't care too much about format, but rather parse raw data and format it later
